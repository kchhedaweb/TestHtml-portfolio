<h3> Khichdi 2</h3>
<p> The crazy Parekh family returns with their shenanigans. This time, the TIA’s (Thodi Intelligent Agency) agent, Kaushal (Anant Vidhaat) tasks them with a secret operation to head to a fictional and joyless country, Paanthukistan, and abduct its emperor who bears an uncanny resemblance to Praful Parekh (Rajeev Mehta). What follows is something you’d expect from director Aatish Kapadia’s popular franchise — scatterbrained characters making a mess of the situation.</p>
<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>Having craved for his rich father’s (Anil Kapoor) love and attention all his life, an unhinged Vijay (Ranbir Kapoor) gets obsessive and violent when his dad is attacked. Seeking revenge and hunting down the conspirators become his only aim. Picture Godfather on steroids, devoid of its psychological tension</p>
<h3> Tiger 3</h3>
<p>Tiger (Salman Khan) and his partner Zoya (Katrina Kaif) face a harrowing personal threat when a vengeful terrorist, Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi) from Pakistan, issues an ultimatum— they must comply with his demands or risk losing their son to a brutal fate.</p>
